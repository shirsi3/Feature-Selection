# Lab 4: Data Preprocessing and Feature Selection in Python

This lab includes several scripts focusing on data preprocessing, sampling techniques, feature selection, and machine learning model preparation.

## 1. lab4_q1.py - Basic Data Analysis

- **Functionality:** Performs basic data analysis, such as counting class occurrences in a dataset.
- **Libraries Used:** pandas

## 2. lab4_q2.py - Random Over-Sampling

- **Functionality:** Implements Random Over-Sampling to balance a dataset.
- **Libraries Used:** pandas, imblearn.over_sampling

## 3. lab4_q3.py - SMOTE Over-Sampling

- **Functionality:** Applies SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) for balancing data.
- **Libraries Used:** pandas, imblearn.over_sampling, sklearn.preprocessing

## 4. lab4_q4.py - Random Under-Sampling

- **Functionality:** Utilizes Random Under-Sampling technique to balance a dataset.
- **Libraries Used:** pandas, imblearn.under_sampling

## 5. lab4_q5.py - Feature Selection using Chi-Squared

- **Functionality:** Selects top features based on the Chi-Squared statistic.
- **Libraries Used:** pandas, sklearn.feature_selection

## 6. lab4_q6.py - Feature Selection using Percentile

- **Functionality:** Chooses features based on a percentile using Chi-Squared or mutual information.
- **Libraries Used:** pandas, sklearn.feature_selection
